debugger for this awful homework

# Please star this repo if it helped you :)
## usage (linux and MACos is supported)

1. name your program as a.out(or you can edit the bash), and put it under this repo, along with the ref program
2. in the bash script you can see "python case.py $number$", this is the number of cities you can edit it to a small size
3. then run the script. it will automatically stop if your answer is not identical to the ref's
4. when it stops you can look at Output.txt, this is the testcase which caused wrong answer.
5. when it runs smoothly, larger the number of cities.
6. if it runs unstoppable with great number of cities, you can try submit your code.
